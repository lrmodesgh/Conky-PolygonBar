Conky - Polygon Bar
===================

Conky System Monitor in Polygonized Bar Style. I like to share it. Change it and let it evolve.

### Learning Resources :

1. :information_source: 	[Conky in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conky_%28software%29)
2. :information_source: 	[Documentation of Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/documentation.html)
2. :cool:	[See how people are expressing their Digital Art with Conky](http://conky-artists-group.deviantart.com/)

### Tools Required :

1. Conky
2. Lua
3. Cairo Library

### Instructions :

1. Pull or Download the repository, Extract it
2. After extraction, copy ".startconky.sh" file present inside the extracted directory to the home directory (startconky.sh --> home)
3. Copy the .conky directory to the home directory (.conky --> home)
4. Add startconky.sh to the startup programs (use gnome-session-properties in gnome-shell based sytems)
5. To adjust the startup delay, one can edit the startconky.sh script
6. To add your face or logo into the conky logo/face area :
 6.a. Remove the logo_or_face.png
 6.b. copy the image of interest into .conky/polygonbar/images and rename it as logo_or_face.png
7. Restart your system or simply logout and log in

### Project Related Resources :

1. Download Conky from Sourceforge [Conky @ Source Forge](http://conky.sourceforge.net/), if you are interested in install it by compiling it from source
2. My Laptop gnome-shell with my own PolygonBar Conky ![Final Edition](/finaledition.png)

### Uses :

1. Anybody can customize their system monitor suiting their personal style
2. Helps learn what are all the data than can be visualized in one's own personal computer
3. Builds - Rich, Intitutive, Visualization, Information Graphics, User Interface --> Designing knowledge (but not interactive)
4. Involves lot of fun when it is DIY
5. Lua can be understood and learned in an interesting and funny way
6. Cairo drawing methodology can be learned easily - along with Vector Math and Geometry

### Possible Modifications:

1. Pragmatically anything can be modified in conky
2. In this context bar background can be changed to some other patterns like voronoi or delaunay triangulations
3. Ribbons can be added for bigger screens and conky with different width
4. Ribbon colours can be changed
5. Lua-Cairo Widgets can be created while additional parameters
